Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by technology and problem-solving. My journey began with tinkering with computers and coding simple programs, leading me to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the  University of Illinois Chicago. As I explore this field, Iâ€™m continually amazed by technology's ability to transform lives and create innovative solutions. I'm excited to learn, grow, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts in the coding and development community.

ðŸŒŸ Projects

Project 01 - Totalistic Cellular Automaton.

In this project, I implemented a simple one-dimensional totalistic cellular automaton, which simulates the evolution of cells on a grid. Each cell can take on one of three statuses (0, 1, or 2), representing states such as inactive, at-risk, or thriving. The evolution of each cell depends on the sum of its status and the statuses of its neighboring cells. By applying a user-defined rulenumber, the automaton evolves over multiple generations, visualizing the world as it changes. This project provides insight into how simple rules can lead to complex behaviors.
One key technical skill applied in this project is dynamic memory management. I used an array of structs to represent the grid, where each cell is a struct containing its status, local sum, and an accumulated count of active statuses. The struct-based approach allows for efficient updates and storage of cell statuses as the world evolves. Additionally, understanding binary-to-ternary conversions was crucial for mapping the rule number to the possible cell status changes.

Project 02 - Ciphers.

This project, part of CS 251, introduces key C++ concepts through the implementation of encryption algorithms like the Caesar and substitution ciphers. As a solo project, students must decide on the program structure while adhering to restrictions like avoiding global variables and limiting the use of certain libraries.
Key skills applied in this project include working with C++ standard libraries, specifically utilizing strings, vectors, and file streams. One of the main tasks involves implementing Caesar cipher encryption and decryption, requiring a deep understanding of algorithm design and function overloading in C++. The project also involves writing utility functions, reading from files, and running tests using a provided Makefile.
